    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        PMomos, delightful steamed dumplings, trace their origins to Tibet and Nepal, where they have been a staple food for centuries, deeply embedded in the culinary landscape of the Himalayan region. Influenced by Chinese baozi and jiaozi, momos evolved to suit local tastes and ingredients. They historically served as a nutritious and portable meal, particularly for traders traversing the ancient Silk Road. As Tibetan and Nepalese communities migrated, especially to India and other parts of South Asia, momos spread, gaining immense popularity and adapting to regional palates with various fillings and accompanying dipping sauces.

        Crafting momos involves preparing a simple dough from flour and water, which is then rolled into thin, circular wrappers. These delicate wrappers are filled with a savory mixture, commonly seasoned minced meat or finely chopped vegetables, often spiced with ginger, garlic, and onions. The filled dumplings are then carefully folded into various traditional shapes, such as half-moons or pleated purses. Finally, they are gently steamed until the wrapper becomes translucent and tender, and the filling is cooked through, resulting in a soft, juicy bite.

    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the Dough: In a bowl, mix flour and salt. Gradually add water and knead until you form a smooth, firm dough. Cover and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare the Filling: In another bowl, combine all the chosen filling ingredients (minced chicken/vegetables, onion, ginger, garlic, chilies, soy sauce, sesame oil, pepper, salt, etc.). Mix well to ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape the Momos: Divide the rested dough into small portions. Roll each portion into a thin, small circle (wrapper). Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each wrapper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold the Momos: Carefully pleat and fold the edges of the wrapper around the filling to create a sealed dumpling in your desired shape (e.g., half-moon, round purse).
        </li>
        <li>
            Steam the Momos: Grease the trays of a steamer. Arrange the shaped momos on the trays, ensuring they don't touch each other. Pour water into the bottom of the steamer and bring it to a boil. Place the trays in the steamer, cover, and steam for 10-15 minutes, or until the wrappers are translucent and the filling is cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve: Carefully remove the momos from the steamer and serve hot with a spicy momo chutney or dipping sauce.
