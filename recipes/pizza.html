    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza's origins trace back to ancient flatbreads topped with various ingredients, enjoyed across cultures for millennia. However, the pizza we recognize today truly evolved in 18th-century Naples, Italy. Initially a humble street food for the city's working class, it gained royal approval in 1889 when Queen Margherita famously favored a pie adorned with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil—colors of the Italian flag. This "Pizza Margherita" elevated its status, paving the way for pizza's global popularity, especially after Italian immigrants brought it to America in the late 19th century.

        Making a classic pizza involves preparing a simple yeast-leavened dough, allowing it to rise to achieve a light and airy crust. This dough is then stretched or rolled into a round, forming the base. A flavorful tomato sauce is spread evenly, leaving a border for the crust, followed by a generous layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Finally, the pizza is baked at a high temperature until the crust is golden and crisp, and the cheese is melted and bubbly, creating a universally loved dish.

            Activate Yeast & Prepare Dough: Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt, then add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Knead until a smooth, elastic dough forms. Cover and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat Oven & Prepare Pan: Preheat your oven to a high temperature (around 450-500°F or 230-260°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat. Lightly grease a pizza pan or dust a pizza peel with cornmeal.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape Dough: Punch down the risen dough to release air. Divide it if making multiple pizzas. On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll the dough into your desired pizza shape and thickness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add Toppings: Transfer the shaped dough to your prepared pan or peel. Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Sprinkle generously with mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake: Carefully slide the pizza into the preheated oven. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve: Remove from the oven, let cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve hot.
